This repo is for projects using freeRTOS in STM32F103 complied by KeilC.
I'll start doing tutorials using freeRTOS in STM32F103 based on the content in a book, namely Beginning STM32 Developing with FreeRTOS, libopencm3 and GCC by Warren Gay (link). I found hard to implement what wrote in the book with author's instruction; especially for those who aren't familiar with Linux-based developement environment. Thus I decided to used KeilC and STM32 standard libarary to implement the book's content.
