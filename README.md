This repo is for projects using freeRTOS in STM32F103 complied by KeilC.
I'll start doing tutorials using freeRTOS in STM32F103 based on the content in a book, namely Beginning STM32 Developing with FreeRTOS, libopencm3 and GCC by Warren Gay ([link])(https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-STM32-Developing-FreeRTOS-libopencm3/dp/1484236238). I found hard to implement what wrote in the book with author's instruction; especially for those who aren't familiar with Linux-based developement environment. Thus I decided to used KeilC and STM32 standard libarary to implement the book's content.
